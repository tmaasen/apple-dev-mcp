## Common Contribution Types

### üîß Scraper Fixes (Most Common)

Apple occasionally updates their website structure, breaking our content extraction. These are the most valuable community contributions!

**When to fix scrapers:**
- Daily health checks are failing
- Content extraction returns empty or malformed results
- New HIG sections aren't being discovered

**How to fix scrapers:**

1. Identify the broken URL by checking the failing tests or issues
2. Open the URL in your browser to verify if it exists
3. Update the URLs in the `knownSections` array in `src/scraper.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Update or add new HIG section URLs
   const knownSections = [
     { title: 'iOS Navigation', url: 'https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation', platform: 'iOS', category: 'navigation' },
     // Add new sections here
   ];
   ```

4. Test locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run health-check
   ```

5. Submit a PR with the updated URLs

**Note**: Since Apple's HIG website is now a Single Page Application (SPA), we maintain a curated list of stable URLs rather than scraping dynamically.

### üÜï New Features

Ideas for new features:
- Support for additional Apple platforms
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Better content formatting
- Integration with design tools
- Historical HIG comparisons

### üìö Documentation

Help improve:
- Installation guides
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

### üêõ Bug Fixes

Common issues:
- Error handling improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Cache management
- Memory leaks

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with MCP Inspector:**
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/server.js
   ```

3. **Run automated tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```

### Testing Scrapers

When fixing scrapers, test with real URLs:

```bash
# Test specific URLs manually
node -e "
const { HIGScraper } = require('./dist/scraper.js');
const { HIGCache } = require('./dist/cache.js');
const scraper = new HIGScraper(new HIGCache());
scraper.discoverSections().then(console.log);
"
```
