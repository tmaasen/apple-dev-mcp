## Common Contribution Types

### üîç Content Discovery Improvements (Most Important)

Our pure dynamic architecture discovers content in real-time. The most valuable contributions are helping improve content discovery and processing!

**When to improve content discovery:**
- Apple releases new HIG sections or changes website structure
- JavaScript error pages are detected
- Content extraction fails for specific pages
- New Apple platforms or design systems are released

**How to improve content discovery:**

1. **Test server functionality:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Test specific content extraction:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:automation
   ```

3. **Monitor discovery performance:**
   - Check CrawleeHIGService logs for failed discoveries
   - Verify ContentProcessor handles new page structures
   - Ensure JavaScript error page detection works correctly

### üîß Content Processing Fixes

The dynamic architecture relies on robust content processing. Important for reliability!

**When to fix content processing:**
- JavaScript error pages are being cached
- New HIG sections aren't being discovered
- Content extraction returns malformed results

**How to fix content processing:**

1. Identify failed content extraction patterns
2. Update `ContentProcessor` for new page structures
3. Test the functionality:
   ```bash
   npm test                  # Test server functionality
   npm run test:automation   # Test processing pipeline
   ```

### üÜï New Features

Ideas for new features:
- **Desktop Extension improvements**: Better UX, configuration options
- **Unified search enhancements**: Improved design + technical integration
- **Enhanced dynamic content discovery**: Better performance and coverage
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Cross-reference improvements, wildcard patterns
- **Additional Apple platforms support**: New platforms and frameworks
- **Cache optimization**: Improved TTL strategies and invalidation
- **Performance monitoring**: Better tracking of discovery and processing metrics

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Build and run:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with MCP Inspector:**
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dist/server.js
   ```

3. **Run automated tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   ```

### Testing Scrapers

When fixing scrapers, test with real URLs:

```bash
# Test specific URLs manually
node -e "
const { HIGScraper } = require('./dist/scraper.js');
const { HIGCache } = require('./dist/cache.js');
const scraper = new HIGScraper(new HIGCache());
scraper.discoverSections().then(console.log);
"
```

## Dynamic Content Discovery

### Understanding the Pure Dynamic System

Our architecture uses live content discovery:

1. **Dynamic Discovery**: Real-time crawling of ALL Apple HIG pages
2. **Smart Caching**: TTL-based caching with graceful degradation
3. **Content Processing**: JavaScript-capable extraction with quality validation

### Content Discovery Workflow

```bash
# Test server functionality
npm test

# Test content processing pipeline
npm run test:automation

# Monitor performance
npm run dev  # Check logs for discovery patterns
```

### Dynamic Content Flow

```
User Request ‚Üí CrawleeHIGService ‚Üí Recursive Page Discovery
                    ‚Üì
            Playwright Browser ‚Üí Apple HIG Website
                    ‚Üì
            Content Extraction ‚Üí Quality Validation
                    ‚Üì
