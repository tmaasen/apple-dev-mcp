# iOS Layout

A well-designed layout enhances communication, reduces complexity, and facilitates use across different device sizes and orientations.

## Layout Principles

### Adaptivity
Design interfaces that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, orientations, and dynamic content changes.

### Consistency
Maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing throughout your interface to create a cohesive experience.

### Clarity
Use layout to establish clear visual hierarchy and help users understand the relationships between interface elements.

## Safe Areas

Respect safe areas to ensure your content remains visible and interactive across all device configurations:
- Avoid placing critical content behind system UI elements
- Use safe area guides for proper content positioning
- Consider device-specific features like Dynamic Island and home indicator

## Spacing and Margins

### System Spacing
iOS provides standard spacing values that ensure consistency:
- **Standard margin**: 16-20 points from screen edges
- **Inter-element spacing**: 8-16 points between related elements
- **Section spacing**: 24-32 points between content sections

### Grid Systems
- Use consistent grid systems for content alignment
- Maintain vertical rhythm through consistent spacing
- Consider baseline grids for text-heavy interfaces

## Responsive Design

### Size Classes
Design for different size classes:
- **Compact width**: iPhone in portrait, iPhone landscape (some models)
- **Regular width**: iPad, iPhone Plus/Pro Max landscape
- **Compact height**: iPhone landscape
- **Regular height**: iPhone portrait, iPad

### Adaptive Layouts
- Use Auto Layout to create flexible interfaces
- Design for multiple screen densities and sizes
- Test layouts across different device configurations

## Layout Guidelines

### Content Prioritization
- Place most important content in easily accessible areas
- Use the top portion of the screen for critical information
- Consider thumb reach zones for touch targets

### Visual Balance
- Distribute visual weight evenly across your interface
- Use whitespace effectively to reduce cognitive load
- Align elements to create clean, organized layouts

### Modern Layout Features
Layout in Apple's current design system features:
- Enhanced depth perception through sophisticated visual layering
- Adaptive spacing that responds to content and context
- Improved visual hierarchy through refined elevation principles
- Dynamic layout adjustments for optimal user experience
