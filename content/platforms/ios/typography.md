# iOS Typography

Typography is a fundamental part of your app's user interface, helping establish hierarchy, express brand personality, and improve readability.

## Dynamic Type

iOS provides Dynamic Type, which enables users to scale text to a comfortable reading size. Your app should support Dynamic Type to ensure accessibility and user preference accommodation.

### Text Styles

#### Display Text Styles
- **Large Title**: 34pt - Prominent page or section titles
- **Title 1**: 28pt - Primary section headings
- **Title 2**: 22pt - Secondary section headings  
- **Title 3**: 20pt - Tertiary headings and group titles

#### Body Text Styles
- **Headline**: 17pt, semibold - Emphasized content headings
- **Body**: 17pt - Primary content and reading material
- **Callout**: 16pt - Secondary content emphasis
- **Subhead**: 15pt - Descriptive and supplementary content

#### Detail Text Styles
- **Footnote**: 13pt - Supplementary information
- **Caption 1**: 12pt - Image captions and secondary details
- **Caption 2**: 11pt - Minimal supporting text

## Typography Guidelines

### Hierarchy
Establish clear visual hierarchy through:
- Font size variations
- Font weight differences  
- Color and contrast adjustments
- Spacing and positioning

### Readability
- Use sufficient line spacing for comfortable reading
- Ensure adequate character spacing
- Maintain appropriate line length (45-75 characters)
- Test text at various Dynamic Type sizes

### Accessibility
- Support Dynamic Type scaling
- Maintain contrast ratios for text accessibility
- Test with accessibility features like VoiceOver
- Consider bold text accessibility setting

### Best Practices
- Use system fonts when possible for consistency
- Limit the number of font families in your interface
- Ensure text remains legible at all supported sizes
- Consider localization impact on text layout and spacing

### Modern Typography Features
Typography in Apple's current design system features:
- Enhanced text rendering with refined visual quality
