The HIG contains guidance and best practices that can help you design a great experience for any Apple platform.

As you design interfaces for Apple platforms, keep these principles in mind:

Hierarchy

Establish a clear visual hierarchy where controls and interface elements elevate and distinguish the content beneath them.

Harmony

Align with the concentric design of the hardware and software to create harmony between interface elements, system experiences, and devices.

Consistency

Adopt platform conventions to maintain a consistent design that continuously adapts across window sizes and displays.

For developer guidance, see Adopting Liquid Glass.
