## Implementation Notes

- Use NavigationView/NavigationStack for SwiftUI or UINavigationController for UIKit
- Configure navigation bar appearance for both light and dark modes
- Ensure navigation hierarchy is logical and predictable for users
- Test navigation with different screen sizes and orientations


## Code Examples

### SwiftUI Navigation

Navigation setup with proper hierarchy and title configuration

```swift
NavigationView {
    List {
        // Your content here
        ForEach(items) { item in
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView(item: item)) {
                Text(item.title)
            }
        }
    }
    .navigationTitle("Title")
    .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.large)
    .toolbar {
        ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
            Button("Add") {
                // Add action
            }
        }
    }
}
```
