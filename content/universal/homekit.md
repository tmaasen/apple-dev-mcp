HomeKitHomeKit lets people securely control connected accessories in their homes using Siri or the Home app on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac.In iOS, the Home app also lets people manage and configure accessories.Your iOS, tvOS, or watchOS app can integrate with HomeKit (and by extension the Home app) to provide a custom or accessory-specific experience. For example, you can:Help people set up, name, and organize their accessoriesAllow fine-grained accessory configuration and controlProvide access to custom accessory featuresShow people how to create powerful, hands-free automationsProvide supportFor developer guidance, see HomeKit. If you‚Äôre an MFi licensee, visit the MFi portal for guidance on naming and messaging for accessory packaging.Terminology and layoutHomeKit models the home as a hierarchy of objects and defines a vocabulary of terms that refer to them. The Home app uses the HomeKit object model and terminology to give people intuitive control of accessories by voice, app, and automation.It‚Äôs crucial for your app to use the terminology and object model that HomeKit defines, so that you can reinforce people‚Äôs understanding and make home automation feel approachable.In the HomeKit model, the home object is the root of a hierarchy that contains all other objects, such as rooms, accessories, and zones. When there‚Äôs more than one home, each home is the root of a different hierarchy.Acknowledge the hierarchical model that HomeKit uses. Even if your app doesn‚Äôt organize accessories by rooms and zones in its UI, it‚Äôs useful to reference the HomeKit model when helping people set up or control their accessories. People need to know where accessories are located so they can use Siri and HomePod to control them by speaking commands like ‚ÄúSiri, turn on the lights upstairs,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dark in here.‚Äù For more guidance, see Siri interactions.Make it easy for people to find an accessory‚Äôs related HomeKit details. If your app‚Äôs organization is based on accessories, don‚Äôt hide other HomeKit information, such as an accessory‚Äôs zone or room, in a hard-to-discover settings screen. Instead, consider making the related HomeKit information easily available in an accessory detail view.Recognize that people can have more than one home. Even if your app doesn‚Äôt support the concept of multiple homes per user, consider providing the relevant home information in an accessory detail view.Don‚Äôt present duplicate home settings. If your app has a different perspective on the organization of a home, don‚Äôt confuse people by asking them to set up all or parts of their homes again or by showing a duplicate settings view. Always defer to the settings people made in the Home app and find an intuitive way to present these details in your UI.HomesHomeKit uses the term home to represent a physical home, office, or other location of relevance to people. One person might have multiple homes.RoomsA room represents a physical room in a home. Rooms don‚Äôt have attributes like size or location; they‚Äôre simply names that have meaning to people, such as Bedroom or Office. When people assign accessories to a room, they can use voice commands like ‚ÄúSiri, turn on all the lights except the bedroom,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSiri, turn on the kitchen and hallway lights.‚ÄùAccessories, services, and characteristicsThe term accessory represents a physical, connected home accessory, like a ceiling fan, lamp, lock, or camera. HomeKit uses category to represent a type of accessory, such as thermostat, fan, or light. Typically, an accessory manufacturer assigns each accessory to a category, but your app can help people make this assignment if necessary. For example, a switch that‚Äôs connected to a fan or a lamp needs to be assigned to the same category as the accessory it controls.A controllable feature of an accessory, such as the switch on a connected light, is known as a service. Some accessories offer multiple services. For example, a connected garage door might let people control the light and the door separately, or a connected outlet might support separate control of the top outlet and the bottom outlet. Apps don‚Äôt use the word service in the UI; instead, they use names that describe the service, such as garage door opener and ceiling fan light. When people use Siri to control the accessories in their homes, they speak the service name, not the accessory name. For more guidance on naming, see Help people choose useful names.A characteristic is a controllable attribute of a service. For example, in a ceiling fan, the fan service might have a speed characteristic and the light service might have a brightness characteristic. Apps don‚Äôt use the word characteristic in the UI; instead, they use terms that describe the attribute, such as speed and brightness.A service group represents a group of accessory services that someone might want to control as a unit. For example, if there‚Äôs a floor lamp and two table lamps in one corner of a room, people might assign all three services to a service group named reading lamps. Doing so would let people use the reading lamps service group to control these three lights independently of all other lights in the room.Actions and scenesThe term action refers to the changing of a service‚Äôs characteristic, such as adjusting the speed of a fan or the brightness of a light. People and automation can initiate actions.A scene is a group of actions that control one or more services in one or more accessories. For example, people might create a Movie Time scene that lowers the shades and dims the lights in the living room, or a Good Morning scene that turns on the lights, raises the shades, and starts the coffee maker in the kitchen.TipThe HomeKit API uses the term action set instead of scene. In your app‚Äôs UI, always use the term scene.AutomationsAutomations cause accessories to react to certain situations, such as when a person‚Äôs location changes, a particular time of day occurs, another accessory turns on or off, or a sensor detects something. For example, an automation could turn on the house lights at sunset or when people arrive home.ZonesA zone represents an area in the home that contains multiple rooms, such as upstairs or downstairs. Setting up a zone is optional, but doing so lets people control multiple accessories at one time. For example, assigning all downstairs lights to a zone named downstairs lets people use voice commands like ‚ÄúSiri, turn off all the lights downstairs.‚ÄùSetupUse the system-provided setup flow to give people a familiar experience. The HomeKit setup flow works more quickly than traditional setup flows because it lets people name accessories, join networks, pair with HomeKit, assign room and service categories, and designate favorites in just a few steps. Using the system-provided setup flow lets you concentrate on promoting the custom functionality that makes your accessory unique. For developer guidance, see performAccessorySetup(using:completionHandler:).Provide context to explain why you need access to people‚Äôs Home data. Create a purpose string with a phrase that describes why you‚Äôre asking for permission to access data, such as ‚ÄúLets you control this accessory with the Apple Home app and Siri across your Apple devices.‚ÄùDon‚Äôt require people to create an account or supply personal information. Instead, defer to HomeKit for any information you might need. If your app provides additional services that require an account, such as cloud services, make account setup optional and wait until after initial HomeKit setup to offer it.Honor people‚Äôs setup choices. When people choose to use HomeKit to set up your accessory, don‚Äôt force them to set up other platforms during the HomeKit setup flow. A cross-platform setup experience prevents people from using the accessory right away and can cause confusion by presenting too many ways to control the accessory.Carefully consider how and when to provide a custom accessory setup experience. Always begin by presenting the system-provided setup flow. Then, after the accessory‚Äôs basic functionality is available, offer a custom post-setup experience that highlights the unique features of your accessory and helps people get the most out of it. For example, a light manufacturer‚Äôs app could help people create personalized light scenes in their homes using key colors scanned in from photos in their library.Help people choose useful namesSuggest service names that suit your accessory. If your app detects when someone creates a suboptimal name for Siri voice controls, recommend alternatives that you know will work well for most people. Never suggest company names or model numbers for use as service names.Check that the names people provide follow HomeKit naming rules. If your app lets people rename services, make sure that the new names follow the rules. (The system-provided setup flow automatically checks the original names.) If people enter a name that breaks one or more rules, briefly explain the problem and suggest some alternative names that work. Here are the rules:Use only alphanumeric, space, and apostrophe characters.Start and end with an alphabetic or numeric character.Don‚Äôt include emojis.Example service namesReading lampüìö lamp2nd garage door#2 garage doorHelp people avoid creating names that include location information. Although it‚Äôs natural for someone to use ‚Äúkitchen light‚Äù to name a light in the kitchen, including the room name in the service name can lead to unpredictable results when controlling the accessory by voice. Your app can detect service names that duplicate location information and help people fix them. For example, you might present a post-setup experience that removes the room or zone from a service name and encourages people to assign the accessory to that room or zone instead.Siri interactionsHomeKit supports powerful, hands-free control using voice commands. You can help people use Siri to interact with accessories, services, and zones in their home quickly and efficiently.Present example voice commands to demonstrate using Siri to control accessories during setup. As soon as people complete the setup of a new accessory, consider using the service name they chose in a few example Siri phrases and encourage people to try them out.After setup, consider teaching people about more complex Siri commands. People might not be aware of the broad range of natural language phrases they can use with Siri and HomePod to control their accessories. After setup is complete, find useful places throughout your app to help people learn about these types of commands. For example, in a scene detail view, you could tell people, You can say ‚ÄúHey Siri, set ‚ÄòMovie Time.‚Äô‚ÄùIn addition to recognizing the names of homes, rooms, zones, services, and scenes, Siri can also use information such as accessory category and characteristic to identify a service. For example, when people use terms like brighter or dim, Siri recognizes that they‚Äôre referring to a service that has a brightness characteristic, even if they don‚Äôt speak the name of the service.To illustrate the power and flexibility of Siri commands, here are some examples of the types of phrases that people could use to control their accessories.PhraseSiri understands‚ÄúTurn on the floor lamp‚ÄùService (floor lamp)‚ÄúShow me the entryway camera‚ÄùService (entryway camera)‚ÄúTurn on the light‚ÄùAccessory category (light)‚ÄúTurn off the living room light‚ÄùRoom (living room)Accessory category (light)‚ÄúMake the living room a little bit brighter‚ÄùRoom (living room)Accessory category (implied)Brightness characteristic (brighter)‚ÄúTurn on the recessed lights‚ÄùService group (recessed lights)‚ÄúTurn off the lights upstairs‚ÄùAccessory category (lights)Zone (upstairs)‚ÄúDim the lights in the bedroom and nursery‚ÄùAccessory category (lights)Brightness characteristic (dim)Rooms (bedroom, nursery)‚ÄúRun Good night‚ÄùScene (Good night)‚ÄúIs someone in the living room?‚ÄùAccessory category (implied)Occupancy detection characteristic (implied)‚ÄúIs my security system tripped?‚ÄùAccessory category (security system)‚ÄúDid I leave the garage door open?‚ÄùAccessory category (garage door)Open characteristic (open)‚ÄúDid I forget to turn off the lights in the Tahoe House?‚ÄùAccessory category (lights)Home (Tahoe House)‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dark in here‚ÄùCurrent home (here)Current room (via HomePod)Accessory category (implied)Recommend that people create zones and service groups, if they make sense for your accessory. If people might benefit from using context-specific voice commands to control your accessory, suggest these types of interactions and help people set them up. For example, if you provide an accessory such as a light, switch, or thermostat, you could suggest setting up a zone named ‚Äúupstairs‚Äù or a service group named ‚Äúmedia center‚Äù to support commands like ‚ÄúSiri, turn off the upstairs lights,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSiri, activate the media center.‚ÄùOffer shortcuts only for accessory-specific functionality that HomeKit doesn‚Äôt support. HomeKit lets people use ordinary (or natural) language to control accessories without requiring any additional configuration, so you avoid confusing people by offering shortcuts that duplicate HomeKit functionality. Instead, consider offering shortcuts for complementary functionality that your app provides. For example, if people often want to order filters for an air conditioner that you support, you might offer a shortcut like ‚ÄúOrder AC filters.‚Äù To learn how to provide phrases that people can use for shortcuts, see Shortcuts and suggestions.If your app supports both HomeKit and shortcuts, help people understand the difference between these types of voice control. People can get confused if they‚Äôre presented with multiple methods of voice control. Be sure you clearly indicate what‚Äôs possible with shortcuts, and never encourage people to create a shortcut for a scene or action that HomeKit already supports.Custom functionalityYour app is a great place to help people appreciate the unique functionality of your accessory. For example, an app for a light that displays different colors could help people create HomeKit scenes using colors imported from their photos.Be clear about what people can do in your app and when they might want to use the Home app. For example, if your app supports only lights, consider encouraging people to create a ‚ÄúMovie Time‚Äù scene that not only dims the lights, but also closes the shades, and turns on the TV to a specific input. To do this, first guide people to set up a scene that includes only your accessory‚Äôs actions ‚Äî in this scenario, dimming the lights. Then, your app can suggest that people open the Home app to add their HomeKit-compatible shades and TV to the scene you helped them create. For guidance on how to refer to the Home app, see Referring to HomeKit.Defer to HomeKit if your database differs from the HomeKit database. Give people a seamless experience by automatically reflecting changes made in the Home app or in other third-party HomeKit apps. If you must ask people to manage conflicts in your app, present the conflict visually so that they have a clear picture of the choice they need to confirm. For example, if someone changes an accessory‚Äôs service name in the Home app, your app can detect this change and could show both names side by side to confirm that the person wants to use the new name in your app, too.Ask permission to update the HomeKit database when people make changes in your app. You don‚Äôt want to surprise people by changing something in the Home app, so it‚Äôs essential to get permission or an indication of intent before you write to the database. In particular, never overwrite HomeKit database settings without a person‚Äôs explicit direction.CamerasYour app can display still images or streaming video from a connected HomeKit IP camera.Don‚Äôt block camera images. It‚Äôs fine to supplement the camera‚Äôs content with useful features, such as an alert calling attention to potentially interesting activity. However, avoid covering portions of the camera‚Äôs images with other content.Show a microphone button only if the camera supports bidirectional audio. A nonfunctioning microphone button takes up valuable display space in your app and risks confusing people.Using HomeKit iconsUse the HomeKit icon in setup or instructional communications related to HomeKit technology.In addition, you can use the Apple Home app icon when referencing the Apple Home app or in a button that opens the Apple Home app product page in the App Store.Use only Apple-provided icons. Don‚Äôt create your own HomeKit or Home app icon design or attempt to mimic the Apple-provided designs. Download HomeKit icons in Resources.StylesYou have several options for displaying the HomeKit icon.Black HomeKit iconUse the HomeKit icon on white or light backgrounds when other technology icons appear in black.White HomeKit iconUse the HomeKit icon on black or dark backgrounds when other technology icons appear in white.Custom color HomeKit iconUse a custom color when other technology icons appear in the same color.Position the HomeKit icon consistently with other technology icons. When other technology icons are contained within shapes, treat the HomeKit icon in the same manner.Use the HomeKit icon noninteractively. Don‚Äôt use the icon and the name HomeKit in custom interactive elements or buttons. You can use the Apple Home app icon to open the app‚Äôs product page in the App Store.Don‚Äôt use the HomeKit icon within text or as a replacement for the word HomeKit. See Referring to HomeKit to learn how to properly reference HomeKit in text.Pair the icon with the name HomeKit correctly. You can show the name below or beside the icon if other technologies are referenced in this way. Use the same font that‚Äôs used on the rest of your layout. For related guidance, see Referring to HomeKit.Using the icon and name in setup or instructional contentUsing the icon and name referencing the Apple Home appReferring to HomeKitEmphasize your app over HomeKit. Make references to HomeKit or Apple Home less prominent than your app name or main identity.Adhere to Apple‚Äôs trademark guidelines. Apple trademarks can‚Äôt appear in your app name or images. In text, use Apple product names exactly as shown on the Apple Trademark List.Use Apple product names in singular form only; do not make Apple product names possessive.Don‚Äôt translate Apple, Apple Home, HomeKit, or any other Apple trademark.Don‚Äôt use category descriptors. For example, say iPad, not tablet.Don‚Äôt indicate any kind of sponsorship, partnership, or endorsement from Apple.Attribute Apple, HomeKit, and all other Apple trademarks with the correct credit lines wherever legal information appears within your app.Refer to Apple devices and operating systems only in technical specifications or compatibility descriptions.Example textUse HomeKit to turn on your lights from your iPhone or iPad.Use HomeKit to turn on your lights from your iOS devices.See Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks.Referencing HomeKit and the Home appUse correct capitalization when using the term HomeKit. HomeKit is one word, with an uppercase H and uppercase K, followed by lowercase letters. Apple Home is two words, with an uppercase A and uppercase H, followed by lowercase letters. If your layout displays only all-uppercase designations, HomeKit or Apple Home can be typeset in all uppercase to match the style of the rest of the layout.Don‚Äôt use the name HomeKit as a descriptor. Instead use terms like works with, use, supports, or compatible.Example text\[Brand\] lightbulbs work with HomeKit.HomeKit-enabled thermostat.You can use HomeKit with \[App Name\].HomeKit lightbulbs.Don‚Äôt suggest that HomeKit is performing an action or function.Example textBack door is unlocked with HomeKit.HomeKit unlocked the back door.Use the name Apple with the name HomeKit, if desired.Example textCompatible with Apple HomeKit.Use the name HomeKit for setup, configuration, and instructions, if desired.Example textOpen HomeKit settings.Use the app name Apple Home whenever referring specifically to the app. On the first mention of the app in body copy, use the complete name Apple Home. Subsequent mentions can refer to the Home app.Example textOpen the Apple Home app.Open the Apple Home app. Your accessory and room will now appear in the Home app.Open Home.
